Demo- 
consoles-
1=>cmc-cloud manager console.it completely admin work.
2->Api manager-we create  api, proxy and publish. it genrallay for devloper
3=>Devloper portal- ->consumer,=>it consumer point of view ,login and test api
4=>Devloper tool kit(API designer)-it genrally for CI/CD.(devlopment work)

previsously- to now
api management 4.x
IBM+stongloop(loop vack application and connectors)
APIC 5.x

Devlopment flow--> 
API(Designer)->publish product(API manager)->Devloper portal

API(Api manager)->publish(api manger)->image of the product will be shown in devloper portal

API 		 +  Plan     			=>product
(logic)  (subscripton approval,rate limits)       (api+plan)

product1    product1

api1 api2

we can have multiple api for every  product but each api have one plain.

catalog-dev,test,qa,prod\
Gateways-->datapower,micro gateway
datapower-virtual or physical appliances.
cmc-cloud  management console-we configre servers -gateway server or managemnt server.,,microGateway.
Analystic(servers matrix),servers

User roles-adminm toplogy,syster user, organisation owner.
